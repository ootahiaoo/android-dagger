 * Scoping rules:
 *
 * When a type is marked with a scope annotation, it can only be used by Components that are annotated with the same scope.
 * When a Component is marked with a scope annotation, it can only provide types with that annotation or types that have no annotation.
 * A subcomponent cannot use a scope annotation used by one of its parent Components.
 *
 * Components also involve subcomponents in this context.
